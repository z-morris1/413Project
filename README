# Install AFL++ Docker Environment 
# - docker pull aflplusplus/aflplusplus
# Start AFL++ Container 
# - docker run -ti -v /location/of/your/target:/src aflplusplus/aflplusplus
# Install requests library 
# - pip3 install requests
# Clone companion program from Github 
# - git clone https://github.com/z-morris1/413Project.git
# Navigate to 413Project directory 
# - cd 413Project/
# Generate a text file within the directory containing the source code you wish to test. Ensure that the test file’s main function has a driver written for it compatible with AFL++.  The file “prompt2.txt” is an example of the correct format.
# Run the companion program 
# - python3 APICall.py
# Enter the file name of the text file created in step 5 
# - prompt2.txt
# Enter the number of seeds you wish to generate (3 is recommended, but you can put any number here) 
# - 3 
# Verify that the test seeds were generated 
# - ls testcasesAI/
# Convert text file from step 5 to a c file to be compiled by afl-gcc 
# - mv prompt2.txt prompt2.c
#  Exit the current directory 
# - cd ..
# Compile program to be fuzzed
# - afl-gcc ./413Project/prompt2.c -o ./prompt2
# Run fuzzer
# - afl-fuzz -i ./413Project/testcasesAI -o  /src/findings – ./prompt2 @@
